# 490Q Final Project
## Christopher Kang, Robert Minneker, Julian Roth

This project consists of three modules. The first, NWChem_Experiments, implements a piece of sample code alongside NWChem YAML files to demonstrate Trotterization / Qubitization. The second, VQE, contains the first implementation of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver in Q#. The final is a Python script that allows the conversion of PSI4 to Broombridge, Microsoft's Quantum Chemistry file format.
